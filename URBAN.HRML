  <h3><Center>INTRODUCTION</Center></h3>
  <p>Nowadays, the number of vehicles has increased exponentially, but the bedrock capacities
of roads and transportation systems have not developed in an equivalent way to efficiently cope
with the number of vehicles traveling on them. Due to this, road jamming and traffic correlated
pollution have increased with the associated adverse societal and financial effect on different markets
worldwide. A static control system may block emergency vehicles due to traffic jams. Wireless
Sensor networks (WSNs) have gained increasing attention in traffic detection and avoiding road
congestion. WSNs are very trendy due to their faster transfer of information, easy installation, less
maintenance, compactness and for being less expensive compared to other network options. There
has been significant research on Traffic Management Systems using WSNs to avoid congestion, ensure
priority for emergency vehicles and cut the Average Waiting Time (AWT) of vehicles at intersections.
In recent decades, researchers have started to monitor real-time traffic using WSNs, RFIDs, ZigBee,
VANETs, Bluetooth devices, cameras and infrared signals. This paper presents a survey of current
urban traffic management schemes for priority-based signalling, and reducing congestion and the
AWT of vehicles. The main objective of this survey is to provide a taxonomy of different traffic
management schemes used for avoiding congestion. Existing urban traffic management schemes for
the avoidance of congestion and providing priority to emergency vehicles are considered and set the
foundation for further research.<br>

  <h3><Center>METHODOLOGY</Center></h3>
  <p>Congestion Avoidance Schemes
Traffic congestion is a plight situation on roads that occurs as use increases. It is characterized
by slower vehicle speeds, queuing, and longer trip times. To reduce congestion, several WSN-based
schemes and techniques have been developed and described in the literature.<br>
    
    Priority-Based Traffic Management Schemes
An emergency vehicle is any vehicle that is designated and authorized for emergency service (such
as police, ambulance and fire). Priority-based signalling will give priority to emergency vehicles and
can thus save lives and property. Several WSN-based traffic management schemes and methodologies
have been designed and developed to prioritize emergency vehicles and have been reported in the
literature. It can be found that most of the efforts are related to intelligent traffic control system design
for smooth passage of emergency vehicles<br>
      
      Average Waiting Time Reduction Schemes
Average waiting time refers to the amount of time a vehicle is waiting in a queue before the traffic
signal is ON. This factor increases the travel time and shows a negative impact on transport economy.
To reduce average waiting time, several WSN-based schemes and methodologies have been developed
and stated in the literature.<br>
      As the drivers wait in the traffic light queue, many drivers try to cross the intersection when
the traffic light changes from green to yellow. This causes accidents and traffic congestion. The
proposed techniques try to reduce RLR phenomenon by assigning green times to the road sections
with long queues.<br>

  <h3><Center>ADVANTAGES</Center></h3>
  <p>In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive review of existing urban traffic management
schemes. The main challenges associated with congestion control, average waiting time reduction,
prioritizing emergency vehicles and the design requirements of intelligent traffic system are discussed
to provide an insight into the goals of urban traffic management.<br>
Despite the large number of research activities and the excellent progress that has been made in
traffic management systems in recent years, challenges for further research remains. A few issues are
outlined for future work.
A real-time traffic management system cannot be guaranteed. Processing of large amounts of
real time traffic data, the run time of the control system and reliability are the problems to be solved
to ensure real-time demand of the urban traffic management system. There is a need to design an
intelligent traffic cloud by making use of cloud computing to solve the problems related to real-time.
The use of virtual strips in DTMon [14] can be extended for detecting and tracking of the
End-of-queue, caused by congestion. Intra-vehicle channel interference [28] can be reduced further
by assigning non-overlapping channels to RSUs. Modifying the dynamic traffic management system
using WSN and multi fuzzy logic controllers proposed in [61] to detect emergency vehicles is an option
to consider. Usage of PLCs and SCADA system in intelligent transportation system for smooth traffic
flow can be an interesting issue for future research. Designing a promising traffic management system
to provide smooth traffic flow in non-recursive congestion situation can be an interesting issue for
future research.
In further research, it is recommended that information variables, such as the number of accidents
and traffic violations are to be involved in traffic management system to assist decision makers in the
formulation of traffic rules and policies
