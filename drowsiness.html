  <h3><Center>INTRODUCTION</Center></h3>
  <p>This represents a real-time driver drowsiness detection system for driving safety. Based on computer vision techniques , the driver’s face is located from a color video captured in a car. Then, face detection is employed to locate the regions of the driver’s eyes, which are used as the templates for eye tracking in subsequent frames. Finally, the tracked eye’s images are used for drowsiness detection in order to generate warning alarms. The proposed approach has three phases: Face, Eye detection and drowsiness detection. The role of image processing is to recognize the face of the driver and then extracts the image of the eyes of the driver for detection of drowsiness. The Haar face detection algorithm takes captured frames of image as input and then the detected face as output. Next, CHT is used to tracking eyes from the detected face. If the eyes are closed for a predefined period of time the eyes of the driver will be considered closed and hence an alarm will be started to alert the driver. The proposed system was tested on a Raspberry pi 3 Model B with 1GB RAM with use of Logitech HD Webcam C270. The experimental results appears quite encouraging and promising. The system could reach more than 15 frames per second for face and eye tracking, and the average correct rate for eye location and tracking could achieve 99.0% on some test videos. Thus, it can be concluded that the proposed approach is a low cost and effective solution method for a real-time of driver drowsiness detection.<br>
    
    The medical reason for drowsiness is also different.
The drowsiness of a car driver depends on the secretions in
the body. The body secretions also affect the activities of a
person. There are two types of activities in our body namely
sympathetic and parasympathetic. Sympathetic activities are
controlled by adrenalin secretion. And parasympathetic
activities are controlled by acetylcholine secretion..</p>

<div id="Paris" class="tabcontent">
  <h3><Center>METHODOLOGY</Center></h3>
  <p>There are different methodologies developed for detecting
the driver drowsiness and also preventing the road
accidents.<br>
(A) Vehicle based approach-It is one of the techniques
to find out driver drowsiness. The technique continuously
monitored position of lane, steering wheel position and
pressure on acceleration pedal. If it crosses the threshold
values then it indicate that the driver gets drowsy.<br>
(B)Physiological based approach-In this technique, we
continuously observed pulse rate, heart rate and brain
activity information. ECG is used to calculate the variation in
heart rate and also detect different conditions for
drowsiness. EEG is used to calculate the different electrical
activities of brain. In order to determine the brain activities,
electrodes are placed around the scalp of the car driver.
These electrodes detect the voltages produced in the brain
cortex. This voltages contain three frequencies related to
alpha , beta and gamma waves. These frequencies can be
further processed to calculate drowsiness and different sleep
stages.<br>
(C)Behavioral based approach-This approach includes
yawning (opening area of mouth), eye closure, eye blinking
frequency and head pose. This can be done by placing
camera in front of the car driver. The camera continuously
captures images of the car driver. The car driver’s image is
further processed for detecting drowsiness of the driver.</p>

<div id="Tokyo" class="tabcontent">
  <h3><Center>IMPLEMENTATION</Center></h3>
  <p>Practically, Physiological based approach is not suitable for
drowsiness detection. It is unsafe for driver and
environmental conditions also affected the electrode. Also
Vehicle based approach is not suitable. Because vehicle
based approach is based on monitoring the driving pattern
of the car. But the problem is, it is difficult to determine
when the driver is in micro sleep or in a deep sleep? This
situation is dangerous for the driver and also car. Hence we
are using Behavioral based approach in our project.
Due to secretion of adrenalin and acetylcholine, the
area of opening eye changes. Basically, our eye movements
are controlled by six muscles namely superior rectus,
inferior rectus, lateral rectus, medial rectus, superior oblique
and inferior oblique. And this six muscles activity is
controlled by the nerve. Due to the movements of these
muscles, pupil part of eye is dilated or constricted and iris
part of eye is also constricted or dilated. In order to monitor
the eye movements along with the iris and pupil area, we
have to use a camera for capturing the real time images of
eye.<br>
    
    Our proposed system consists of open source 5
megapixel digital camera for capturing real time images of
car driver. For further processing on that image, we need to
send the image to Raspberry-pi system board. The
Raspberry-pi system is loaded with Raspbian OS and Python
packages for Open CV (Computer Vision). Haar features are
used to calculate required part of the eye (pupil and iris).
Further, Hough transform is used for edge detection of pupil
and iris. Pupil and Iris area is calculated and then it
compares with threshold value. If it exceeds the threshold
value then driver drowsiness condition is detected and
alarm indicated by buzzer. Buzzer is directly connected to
PIC 16F controller and the PIC controller is serially
interfaced with Raspberry-pi system board.
