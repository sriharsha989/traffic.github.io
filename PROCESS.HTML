  <h3><Center>INTRODUCTION</Center></h3>
  <p>Fast transportation systems and rapid transit systems
are nerves of economic developments for any nation.
Mismanagement and traffic congestion results in long
waiting times, loss of fuel and money. It is therefore
utmost necessary to have a fast, economical and efficient
traffic control system for national development. The
monitoring and control of city traffic is becoming a major
problem in many countries. With the ever increasing
number of vehicles on the road, the Traffic Monitoring
Authority has to find new methods of overcoming such a
problem. One way to improve traffic flow and Safety of the
current transportation system is to apply automation and
Intelligent control methods. As the Number of road users
constantly increases, and resources provided by current
infrastructures are limited, intelligent control of traffic will
become a very important issue in the future .<br>
    
    Traffic congestion may result due to heavy traffic at a
junction. To avoid congestion there are so many traffic
management techniques available. But no technique is perfect by itself as the real time situations are generally
continuously changing and the system has to adapt itself
to change in the continuously changing circumstances. We
have made an attempt to provide some traffic
management strategy which is self-changing in nature, so
as to fit into continuously changing real time traffic
scenarios. In this system time is assigned to traffic light of
particular lane according to the traffic density on the road
with priority given to ambulance. Also we can indicate
signal break in a particular lane. If there is an obstacle LCD
is used to display the message of obstacle detection to
avoid inconvenience. </p>

  <h3><Center>METHODOLOGY</Center></h3>
  <p> Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is widely used
technology which converts scanned images of printed text,
handwritten text characters into machine encoded text
information such as ASCII [5]. Number plate recognition is
a form of automatic vehicle identification. A number plate
is the unique identification of vehicle. It is an image
processing technology used to identify vehicles by their
own number plates. Real time number plate recognition
plays an important role in maintaining law enforcement
and maintaining traffic rules. Automatic number plate
recognition has three major parts: vehicle number plate
extraction, character segmentation and Optical Character
Recognition (OCR). Number plate extraction is that stage
where vehicle number plate is detected. The detected
number plate is pre-processed to remove the noise and
then the result is passed to the segmentation part to
segment the individually characters from the extracted
number plate. The segmented characters are normalized
and passed to an OCR algorithm. <br>
    
    Number Plate Extraction<br>
 The captured image is in capital RGB format. It is
converted into grayscale image and into binary image.<br>

  <h3><Center>ADVANTAGES</Center></h3>
  <p> In this project, a method for estimating the traffic using
Image Processing is presented. This is done by using the
camera images captured from the highway and videos
taken are converted to the image sequences. Each image is
processed separately and the number of cars has been
counted. If the number of cars exceeds a specific threshold,
warning of heavy traffic will be shown automatically. The
advantages of this new method include such benefits as
use of image processing over sensors, low cost, easy setup
and relatively good accuracy and speed. Because this
method has been implemented using Image Processing
and Mat lab software, production costs are low while
achieving high speed and accuracy. .<br>
